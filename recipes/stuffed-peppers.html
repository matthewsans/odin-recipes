        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup water </li>
            <li>½ cup uncooked Arborio rice </li>
            <li>2 green bell peppers, halved and seeded </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
            <li>2 green onions, thinly sliced </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried basil </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
            <li>1 pinch ground black pepper </li>
            <li>1 tomato, diced </li>
            <li>½ cup crumbled feta cheese </li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, bring water to a boil. Stir in the rice. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes. Remove from heat, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Place the peppers cut-side down on the prepared baking sheet. Roast 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until tender and skin starts to brown.</li>
            <li>While the peppers are roasting, heat oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. 
                Cook the onions, basil, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper in oil for 2 to 3 minutes. 
                Stir in the tomato, and cook for 5 minutes. Spoon in the cooked rice, and stir until heated through.
                Remove from heat, mix in the feta cheese, and spoon the mixture into the pepper halves.</li>
            <li>Return to the oven for 5 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
