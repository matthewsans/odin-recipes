        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Soba noodles are quick to cook and they work well at room temperature, making them a natural choice for
             a quick or make-ahead vegan lunch. You could even whip up this dish before leaving the house, as it comes 
             together in one pot in under 10 minutes. Although it includes only a few ingredients, it is very flavourful
              — soy sauce and sesame oil bring so much to the table.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 oz soba noodles</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen shelled edamame</li>
            <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 ½ Tbsp sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp sriracha or other chili-garlic hot sauce (optional)</li>
            <li>2 cups finely chopped kale</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the noodles and edamame together until both are tender, about 4 minutes (double check your packages to make sure this is the correct cooking time, as there may be some variation). Drain and rinse under warm water to prevent clumping.</li>
            <li>Toss the cooked noodles and edamame with soy sauce, sesame oil, hot sauce (if using) and kale. Taste and adjust the flavours. Serve.</li>
        </ol>
